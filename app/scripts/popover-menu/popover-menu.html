		<p>The International Christian Medical and Dental Association (ICMDA ) connects Christians in medicine and dentistry all around the world, equipping them to live out their faith at work.

ICMDA is interdenominational and we welcome interaction with individuals or groups who are able to affirm our basis of belief.

ICMDA is a global movement uniting national Christian medical and dental organisations in over 60 countries, and is developing and supporting new movements in other places.

ICMDA seeks to encourage and equip Christian Medical and Dental Students and Graduates to grow to Christian maturity and live out their faith within their clinical practice and beyond.

Christians in medicine and dentistry take their inspiration from Christ, the Great Physician. The example of Jesus in humility washing his disciples’ feet and wiping them with the towel wrapped around his waist is reflected in our logo.</p>
		<blockquote cite="http://example.com/facts">
			<p>‘I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you’

reminds all Christian doctors and dentists that

‘no servant is greater than his master’

John 13:15-16</p>
